# Blackjack
This a classic BlackJack game programmed in python where i've made use of the random library to shuffle the deck and
pop() function to draw cards for the player and the house. There's usage of classes and class inheritance with the use of 
sub funtions so the different tasks are assigned to different chunks of code. a Player can keep betting 
until the deck length falls low and then the deck is reshuffled and player can bet again
